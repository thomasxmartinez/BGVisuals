## üìù What I Learned / Why I Built This

This project demonstrates:
- Advanced use of the Web Audio API and hybrid playback strategies
- Building robust, cross-platform UIs with React and Tailwind
- Performance optimization for real-time graphics and audio
- Clean code organization and security best practices

I built this to push my skills in modern web audio/visualization, and to create a portfolio piece that‚Äôs both technically challenging and visually impressive.

## üó£Ô∏è Lyric Transcription

> The lyric transcript JSON (`public/audio/ballads_4_baddies_transcript.json`) was generated using AssemblyAI‚Äôs speech-to-text API. The app loads this static transcript to display lyrics in sync with the music, but does not make any live API calls or use AI/ML at runtime.
